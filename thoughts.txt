Running FastDownward on Rovers Potassco instances creates trajectories which are too large for FAMA
Tried trimming them artificially to <= 20K (using `truncate`)
Resulted in trajectories with only a few (~ 3) states
FAMA evaluation used random walks to generate trajectories with up to 10 states
Unclear what initial state was used to generate these - could mail authors to find out
Could directly reuse FAMA trajectories to generate action models an re-run evaluation - would have verification for precision and recall metrics as well
Questionable novelty of study
Trajectories of ~1MB are simply not handled by FAMA - crashes with memory exceeded
Not viable when scaling up - might want to use Aaron's algorithm or implement a simple search-based procedure
What is the predicate space for some domain?
Every predicate with every permutation of the same type when a predicate has args of the same type
Or given an action with args of some type - every predicate with args of type which are a subset of action args - includes permutations
Mailed FAMA authors regarding dataset preparation
Tips from them included how to increase Madagascar memory limit and some obscure ways to reduce trajectory size
Could try to design a Sokoban domain with lesser size
Could also use a smaller initial state to generate trajectories randomly - have asked follow-up questions to the authors to clarify the "random" walk procedure
Could try adjusting the Madagascar memory limit and trying with the existing trajectories - was still taking a lot of time before I stopped the search though
(2020-04-28) Rebuilt codebase (excluding evaluation code), need to test it with a smaller trajectory to ensure pipeline works
Which domain + problem to use though? Could use FAMA dataset itself
No problem file in the FAMA dataset, just trajectories
Use Aaron's instances?

For now -
3. Experiment with using Aaron's code for AML and evaluate it
4. Attempt to generate longer trajectories with lesser file size for Sokoban
6. Continue writing paper with current dataset
7. Find small Sokoban instance to try generating a trajectory with
8. Rebuild codebase and setup pipeline again after accidental deletion
9.
